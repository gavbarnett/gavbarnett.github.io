It a Terminal built just for me! (although feel free to use it too)

## Stuff what it can do

It's a Calculator!
It's a cheat sheet!

### Cheat sheet
Type V, I, R or P and get the common electrical equations for each.
### Calculator
Type in your equation :
```
/ 2*3
```
and it will solve it...
```
= 6.00
```
Try Engineering notation:
```
/ 10k+4k
```
and it will resolve it...
```
= 14.00k
```
Or be a Scientist:
```
/ 20e3+4E2
```
and it will disolve it...
```
= 24.00k
```
Raise a pi to Eulers number:
```
/ pi^e
```
and it will compute it...
```
= 22.46
```
Shunt some resistors:
```
/ 5k//5k
```
and it won't be phased...
```
= 2.50k
```
Call up the last answer with ":
```
/ "*4
```
and it will recall it...
```
/ 10k
```
Bound it in brackets:
```
/ (12k+4k)*2^2
```
Always the right answer you will get...
```
= 64.00k
```
